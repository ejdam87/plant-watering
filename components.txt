ESP32 MCU - Dzadam has this
    - Water level reading
    - Moisture level reading
    - Pump signaling
    - Webserver operating

Power Supply Module - Dzadam has this (multiple)
    - Voltage regulation
    - Multi-device powering
    - Voltage can be obtained either from wall outlet, powerbank, direct batteries, ...

Moisture Sensor - Dzadam has this

Water pump - need to buy (multiple times - expecting wearing out)

Proximity sensor (for water level measurements ?) - Dzadam has this

Other primitives (maybe not necessary but could be usefull)
    - jumper wires - dzadam has this
    - resistors - dzadam has this
    - LEDs - dzadam has this

Breadboard for prototyping - Dzadam has this (but kinda small )
